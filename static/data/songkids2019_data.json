      "We are a social movement consisting of people with a passion to empower the next generation to develop their talents using arts, music and leadership forms.", 
      "As a ground-up tribe, we resource the work of children and youth in the 4 to 14 age window. We began locally, in Singapore, giving guitars away to children who could not afford one. Then, we made trips to orphanages and kids centres in Indonesia and Myanmar and did the same for children there.",
      " Soon, we became a movement of like-minded dreamers interested in the work of empowering the next generation. As a movement and not an organisation, we do not store funds. Instead, we raise them as needs arise and we connect the right people with the resources to fulfil our SONG-OUT schemes."
